## Tokyo Olympics 2021 Data Analysis
Conducted an in-depth data analysis for a leading global manufacturing company specializing in the production of cycling equipment and accessories.

### Overview:

I delved into the rich dataset of the Tokyo 2021 Olympics, sourced from Kaggle. The dataset encompassed a comprehensive array of information including athletes, coaches, teams, entries by gender, and the coveted medals won. Utilizing this extensive dataset, I embarked on a journey of exploration and analysis to unearth insightful patterns and trends.

### Technological Architecture:

The project architecture was meticulously designed to ensure seamless data flow and robust analysis. It began with data ingestion facilitated by Azure Data Factory (ADF), which efficiently pulled data from the Kaggle API. Subsequently, Azure Data Lake Gen2 served as the cornerstone for storing the raw and transformed data. Leveraging the power of Databricks, I conducted intricate data transformations to shape the dataset for analysis. The transformed data was then stored back in Azure Data Lake Gen2 for accessibility and scalability. Azure Synapse Analytics emerged as the engine for driving analytics, providing a high-performance environment for querying and processing large datasets. Finally, Power BI was employed to craft intuitive and visually compelling dashboards, offering stakeholders a user-friendly interface to explore the insights gleaned from the data.


### Achievements:

Through rigorous analysis and visualization, I uncovered valuable insights into various aspects of the Tokyo 2021 Olympics. From dissecting medal distributions across different countries to examining the performance of athletes and teams, the project yielded a wealth of actionable insights. Additionally, the seamless integration of Azure services facilitated a streamlined workflow, enhancing efficiency and productivity throughout the project lifecycle.
